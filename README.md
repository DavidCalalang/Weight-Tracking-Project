# Weight Tracking Project

## Implementing a data pipeline scraping notes stored in Google Keep to perform data and trend analysis.

Fitness is a big passion of mine and something that I've done for the past couple of years is keeping track of my weight progress. I initially began by writing them down in paper, but migrated to storing them on my Google Keep app.

This project aims to build a data pipeline that collects such notes and prepares them for data analysis. The main goal being keeping track of trends and fluctuations to gain a better understanding of how my body changes based on different factors such as changing training goals or seasonal changes.
